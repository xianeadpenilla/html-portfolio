    <h1>The Best Movies Acccording to Xian</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Grown Ups</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite movie series because I love comedy movies. I also love Adam Sandler as an actor so it goes without saying that this is one of all-time favorites.</p>

    <h3>She's Out of My League</h3>
    <p>This is my favorite rom-com movie since it tackles some form insecurity that I struggled with in the past. It helped navigate these unfamiliar and weird emotions for me when I was younger so I relate with this a lot.</p>

    <h3>5 Centimeters per Second</h3>
    <p>This movie is my favorite anime movie. The movie talks about life and our progress in it with relation to other people. It shows that life keeps going, no matter how slow. While it is nice to look and reminisce with our past, ultimately, we have to keep going and move on.</p>
